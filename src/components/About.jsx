      I have been learning coding since 1st grade in high school. My interest in the world of coding emerged because I was curious about how programs are created. Since the desire to understand how the program works, I started studying
        programming. Initially, I was interested in creating an IoT program because I was very curious about how an object could be controlled via a remote. Turns out, this involves a low-level programming language, such as
        Java. Once I started understanding Java, I realized that this language is not only used for IoT, but also for various types of programs, including creating websites.

      From my knowledge of the web world with Java, I started to become more interested in the web world. I know that there is a simpler and more powerful language for web development, namely Javascript. After I got to know
        Javascript, I realized that this language is simpler than Java. When I discovered this, I became more interested in Javascript, and now I use Javascript more often for my latest projects.
